# TypeScript New Tools Integration Test Fix Summary

## Problem
The integration tests for the new TypeScript tools (tsExtractType, tsGenerateAccessors, tsCallHierarchy) were failing because:
1. The tools were creating their own LSP client instances instead of using the global one
2. The test environment wasn't properly initializing the LSP server
3. The TypeScript MCP server wasn't including these tools when FORCE_LSP was enabled

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified the tools to use the global LSP client
Updated all three tools to use `getLSPClient()` instead of `createLSPClient()`:
- `/src/ts/tools/tsExtractType.ts`
- `/src/ts/tools/tsGenerateAccessors.ts`
- `/src/ts/tools/tsCallHierarchy.ts`

### 2. Fixed the TypeScript MCP server tool inclusion logic
In `/src/mcp/typescript-mcp.ts`, changed the condition from:
```typescript
// Only include TypeScript-specific tools when not in forced LSP mode
...(process.env.FORCE_LSP !== "true" ? [...] : [])
```
To:
```typescript
// Include TypeScript-specific tools that require LSP when LSP is enabled
...(USE_LSP ? [...] : [])
```

### 3. Updated the test to properly initialize LSP
Modified `/tests/integration/typescript-new-tools.test.ts` to:
- Set `FORCE_LSP=true` in the environment
- Provide `LSP_COMMAND` pointing to the TypeScript language server
- Remove the `.skip` from the describe block

### 4. Fixed async/await issues
Removed unnecessary `await` on `openDocument` calls and added proper delays for LSP processing.

## Current Status

### Working
- ✅ Tools are properly registered and listed
- ✅ Call hierarchy tool works for simple cases
- ✅ Basic error handling works (non-existent files)

### Not Working
- ❌ Extract type refactoring - TypeScript server errors
- ❌ Generate accessors refactoring - TypeScript server errors

## Root Cause
The TypeScript Language Server doesn't fully support these advanced refactoring operations through the standard LSP protocol. These features likely require:
1. TypeScript-specific protocol extensions
2. Direct use of TypeScript Compiler API
3. Or may only be available in the VS Code TypeScript extension

## Recommendations
1. Consider implementing these features using the TypeScript Compiler API directly instead of relying on LSP code actions
2. Document that these tools require specific TypeScript server capabilities that may not be available in all environments
3. Add feature detection to gracefully handle cases where the refactoring actions aren't available
4. Consider marking these tests as experimental or environment-dependent
